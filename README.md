**Employee Attrition Analysis Project<br>**
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition based on an HR dataset, using Power BI and SQL. The project aims to uncover key patterns in employee turnover and provide actionable insights for HR teams to improve employee retention.<br>

**Problem Statement<br>**
The goal of this project is to predict and analyze employee attrition, answering the key question: "Will a particular employee switch to another company or stay?" By analyzing various factors, this project targets employees who are likely to leave, allowing HR teams to take proactive actions.<br>

**Key Metrics & KPIs<br>**
1.Total Employees: 1,470<br>
2.Attrition Cases: 237<br>
3.Attrition Rate: 16%<br>

**Data Insights<br>**
1.Age Group: Employees aged 30-39 show the highest attrition rate.<br>
2.Gender: Male employees have a higher attrition rate compared to females.<br>
3.Job Role: Laboratory Technicians have the highest attrition rate.<br>
4.Salary Hike: Employees receiving a salary hike between 11% and 15% are leaving at a higher rate.<br>

**SQL Approach**<br>
SQL was used to:<br>

1.Extract and preprocess data from the HR database.<br>
2.Perform calculations and aggregations to compute KPIs.<br>
3.Filter and clean data for further analysis.<br>

**Power BI Analysis**<br>
Power BI was used to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard to visualize:<br>

1.Employee demographics (age, gender, job role, etc.).<br>
2.Attrition rates and trends.<br>
3.Insights into the relationship between salary hikes and attrition.<br>

Objective<br>
The main objective of this project is to help HR teams:<br>

1.Identify employees at high risk of attrition.<br>
3.Develop retention strategies by targeting employees who are most likely to leave.<br>

Make data-driven decisions to improve employee satisfaction and reduce turnover.<br>
